After EA's Star Wars Battlefront II debacle I found myself looking at other games to see where else gamers were being gouged for their hard earned dollars.
I found that there was no single repository for demistifying the overly-complicated in-game economies that began in free to play games and are now spreading to AAA titles.
This need seems perfectly solveable to me, so now this site exists! I hope it can help you to make informed decisions about how you spend your gaming time and dollars.
